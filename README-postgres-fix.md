# PostgreSQL Connection Fix

This document describes fixes applied to resolve the PostgreSQL connection issues encountered in the Docker setup:

## Issues Resolved

1. Authentication failures for the PostgreSQL user
2. "database 'krisha' does not exist" errors
3. Connection timeout issues
4. Proper initialization of database and tables

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Initialization

Created a PostgreSQL initialization script at `docker/db-init.sh` that:
- Creates the 'krisha' database if it doesn't exist
- Creates all required tables with proper relationships
- Adds indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Updated docker-compose.yml

- Changed to default `postgres` database for initialization
- Added volume for database initialization script
- Added environment variables for both services

### 3. Improved Connection Handling

- Updated `run_telegram.sh` to handle database connections more robustly
- Added retry mechanisms with proper error handling and timeouts
- Added code to create the database if it doesn't exist

### 4. Enhanced Database Service

- Added connection pooling with proper error handling
- Implemented retry mechanisms throughout the codebase
- Improved error messaging and logging

## How to Deploy the Fix

1. Stop any running containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. Make sure the initialization script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x docker/db-init.sh
   ```

3. Rebuild and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

4. Check the logs to verify proper initialization:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs db
   ```

If the database container was working before but data is causing issues, you might want to reset the database volume:

```bash
docker-compose down -v  # Warning: This removes all data!
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## Monitoring

Watch the database logs for any remaining issues:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f db
```

## Additional Improvements

1. Added transaction isolation levels to reduce lock conflicts
2. Implemented connection pooling for better performance
3. Added proper indexes to improve query performance
4. Added retry logic throughout the codebase for better resilience
5. Implemented better error handling to make troubleshooting easier
